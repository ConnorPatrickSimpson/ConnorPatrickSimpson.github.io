				    <p>Hello, my name is Connor Simpson.</p>
					<p>As a recent graduate of UT Dallas, I am open to all the possibilities afforded to me! The field of computer science as a whole
					   is so varied and complex that I sometimes find it difficult to focus on one specific area. However, I try to make a concious effort
                       to learn underlying system and functionality of any given topic such that I can transfer as much knowledge into my future
					   endeavors. At the very least, a basic understanding of one portion of a system architecture can help immensely when designing
					   and implementing other related portions of said architecture.</p>
					<p>Ever since my involvement in my senior project during my last semester at UT Dallas, I have focused specifically on learning more
					   about frontend web applications and the characteristics of Javascript as a language. However, I still try to maintain a diverse
					   breadth of knowledge, such as also educating myself about design pattern implementation. Even though numerous classic design patterns 
					   from the classic Gang of Four's literature on the subject have already been integrated into modern frameworks, I feel that an understanding 
					   of these patterns and how they are implemented also helps me think more flexibly about writing object-oriented code, particularly when 
					   it comes to code cohesion and coupling.</p>
